Digital Logic Analyzer
This project is a USB digital logic analyzer based on the attiny85 and V-USB. The hardware for usb is minimal with only 2 zener diodes and 3 resistors. The logic analyzing hardware is 2 parllel in serial out shift registers (74hc165) daisy chained together and connected to 3 pins on the attiny85. I'm currently working on debugging the hardware, but this minimal setup was proven to work with the tinyisp firmware for attiny85, so the problem maybe with software issues. The host software is also minimal at this point, but the drawing functions are working with features such as the ability to change scrolling speed for the data lines.

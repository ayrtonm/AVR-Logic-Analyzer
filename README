Digital Logic Analyzer
This project is a USB digital logic analyzer based on the attiny85 and V-USB. The hardware for usb is minimal with only 2 zener diodes and 3 resistors. The logic analyzing hardware is 2 parllel in serial out shift registers (74hc165) daisy chained together and connected to 3 pins on the attiny85. The USB hardware is currently working and can transfer data reliably. The shift register hardware/software is being debugged and is the last link that currently doesn't work. The host software reads the values transfered through usb and displays them with SDL. Currently you can only slow down or speed up the scrolling rate on the screen, but I'm planning on adding more features and finer controls after the shift register hardware works reliably.

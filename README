Digital Logic Analyzer
This project is a USB digital logic analyzer based on the attiny85 and V-USB. The hardware for usb is minimal with only 2 shunt zener diodes on the D+ and D- lines and 3 resistors. The logic analyzing hardware is 2 parllel in serial out shift registers (74HC165) daisy chained together and connected to 3 pins on the attiny85.The host software reads the values transfered through usb and displays them with SDL. Everything is currently working and data can be transferred reliably.
